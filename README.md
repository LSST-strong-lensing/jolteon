# JOLTEON: The JOint Lensed Transient Events Observation Network

![Jolteon](https://github.com/erinhay/jolteon/blob/main/jolteon.png)

## Aims
The Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time is expected to observe hundreds of gravitationally lensed transients. With the JOint Lensed Transient Events Observation Network (JOLTEON), we aim to provide resources for the development of tools for lensed transient discovery with Rubin-LSST. As a community, we will work collaboratively to "catch 'em all!"

## Leadership

JOLTEON is organized by a leadership team formed of Ana Sainz de Murieta, Dan Ryczanowski, Erin Hayes, and Luke Weisenbach. The leadership team is supported by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Strong Lensing Topical Team Leads, Nikki Arendse, Suhail Dhawan, and Anowar Shajib, and the LSST Strong Lensing Science Collaboration (SLSC) Co-Chairs, Graham Smith and Simon Birrer.

We welcome all LSST community members to become collaborators on JOLTEON by joining the ``#sl-transient-search-challenge`` channel on the LSST slack!

## Data
The Extended LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC) provided a sample of millions of simulated transient light curves as expected from Rubin-LSST. Among the simulated objects were resolved gravitationally lensed SN Ia, Ib/c, and II. At the first stage of the project, we will be working at the light curve level to distinguish the resolved lensed SNe from the other transients in the ELAsTiCC data. We plan to extend the ELAsTiCC simulations to include unresolved lensed transients in the future.

We will be releasing jupyter notebooks describing how to access the ELAsTiCC data soon!
