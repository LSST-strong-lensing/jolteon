# JOLTEON: The JOint Lensed Transient Events Observation Network

![Jolteon](https://github.com/erinhay/jolteon/blob/main/jolteon.png)

## Aims
The Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time is expected to observe tens to hundreds of gravitationally lensed transients. With Jolteon, we aim to provide resources for the development of tools for lensed transient discovery with Rubin-LSST. As a community, we will work collaboratively to "catch 'em all!"

## Data
The Extended LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC) provided a sample of millions of simulated transient light curves as expected from Rubin-LSST. Among the simulated objects were resolved gravitationally lensed SN Ia, Ib/c, and II. At the first stage of the project, we will be working at the light curve level to distinguish the resolved lensed SNe from the other transients. We plan to extend the ELAsTiCC simulations to include unresolved lensed transients in the future.

We will be releasing jupyter notebooks describing how to access the ELAsTiCC data soon!
